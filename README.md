# machine-learning-knn
Simple implementation of K-nearest-neighbors algorithm using C++

# Running

* In order to run the application you should build files using make command.
``` make ```

* After building the application, you can run by executing k-nearest-neighbors.
```./k-nearest-nehgbors```

* It will create a result .csv file with the percentage of hits at the first line and at the first column. The file name will change according to the selected parameters.
